# COMP 150 Project

Cori Jacoby, Alex King

### Currently implemented

* Knuth's optimal BST construction algorithm, both its original O(n^3) implementation
and his O(n^2) speedup
* Mehlhorn's O(n*log(n)) approximate optimal BST construction algorithm
* A basic binary search tree class with tests
* A basic benchmarking module to test construction and search times for the two
construction algorithms

### To Do

* A complete testing suite that will allow us to randomly generate probability
distributions for an arbitrary number of keys
* Other extensions
